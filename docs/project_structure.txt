Top-Level Files

	•	README.md: Provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to install, use, and contribute to the project. It’s often the first thing users or contributors read.
	•	setup.py: The setup script for packaging your project. It defines metadata about the project and dependencies, allowing the project to be installed with pip.
	•	requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies needed to run the project. This can be generated with pip freeze for simple projects or manually created for more control.
	•	.gitignore: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore, such as virtual environments, compiled files, and local configurations.

Source Code Directory (src/)

	•	src/: This directory contains the main code for your project. This structure is sometimes preferred as it separates project code from configuration files and testing code.
	•	project_name/: This is the actual Python package directory. Replace project_name with the name of your project.
	•	__init__.py: Marks the directory as a Python package.
	•	module files (e.g., module1.py): These are individual Python files where your code is organized into logical modules.
	•	__main__.py (optional): If you want users to be able to run your package directly with python -m project_name, this file acts as the entry point.

	•	src/project_name/__main__.py:

- Use this file when you want to provide a way to run your package as a script using the python -m project_name command.
- This file should contain the main functionality of your package and should be designed to be the primary entry point for users.

	•	src/main.py:

- Use this file for specific tasks or workflows that are not necessarily part of the main package functionality.
- This file can be used for development purposes, running tests, performing setup tasks, or any other specific tasks that you need to execute.

Testing Directory (tests/)

	•	tests/: This directory contains all test files. Testing is typically organized by module, with each module in src/project_name/ having a corresponding test file in tests/.
	•	__init__.py: This file is optional but can be included if you want the tests directory to be a package.
	•	Test files (e.g., test_module1.py): Each test file typically corresponds to a module in your main code directory and includes test functions to ensure code behaves as expected. You can use testing frameworks like unittest, pytest, or nose.

Documentation Directory (docs/)

	•	docs/ (optional): This directory contains project documentation. If your project is large and needs detailed documentation, you may use a tool like Sphinx to generate documentation here.

Scripts Directory (scripts/)

	•	scripts/ (optional): This directory holds any auxiliary scripts that are not part of the main package but may be useful for setup, maintenance, or automation.
